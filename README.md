# ScoreBoard OBS Overlay

## Application Description
This small web app is written with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and a little bit of PHP. It's main use will be for live streaming my softball team's games. I would be excited for someone else to try it out and let me know what kind of improvements I can make on it.
